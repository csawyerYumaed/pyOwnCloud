NAME
----

oclient - ownCloud CLI client written in python


SYNOPSIS
--------

*oclient* [-h] [-v] [-c 'CONFIG'] [-u 'USER'] [--ssl 'SSLFINGERPRINT']

        [--url 'URL'] [--use-keyring]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Syncing files across machines using ownCloud DAV server.

.Password options:
- You can specify on the cmd line: *-p* (not very safe)
- In the environment variable: 'OCPASS'
- In the owncloud.cfg file as *pass = '<password>'*
- Use keyring to store passwords in a keyring (needs Python Keyring Lib to be installed)
- Do none of the above, and it will prompt you for the password

The choice is yours, if you put it in the cfg file, be careful to
make sure nobody but you can read the file. (0400/0600 file perms).
